# Algo Oracle - Micro Theme Algorithm Generator SaaS

## Description

Algo Oracle is a conceptual SaaS platform designed to empower users to generate specialized algorithms tailored to their specific needs. By leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), the platform aims to understand user requirements in detail and produce reliable, predictive algorithms for various domains such as cryptocurrency, stock markets, productivity, and more.

## How it Works

The platform will guide the user through a series of questions to understand:
1.  **Goal:** What does the user want to achieve or create?
2.  **Algorithm Type:** What kind of algorithm is envisioned?
3.  **Purpose/Domain:** Is it for crypto, stock markets, productivity, or another specific field?
4.  **Specific Requirements:** Detailed parameters, data sources, and desired outcomes.

Based on this input, the integrated LLM (e.g., Google Gemini, Llama 4 via OpenRouter) will:
*   Research and identify the most suitable algorithmic approaches.
*   Generate a "micro theme" algorithm, focusing on specificity and reliability.
*   Iterate with the user if further clarification or refinement is needed.

## Key Features

*   **User-Driven Algorithm Generation:** Puts the user in control of defining the algorithm's purpose and specifications.
*   **LLM-Powered Intelligence:** Utilizes state-of-the-art LLMs to find and construct optimal algorithms.
*   **Multi-Domain Support:** Aims to cater to a wide range of applications, from finance to personal productivity.
*   **Flexible LLM Choice:** Plans to allow users to select their preferred LLM (e.g., Gemini, Llama 4) via an OpenRouter API key.
*   **Focus on Reliability & Prediction:** Strives to produce algorithms that are not just functional but also robust and predictive.

## Technologies (Planned)

*   **Frontend:** (To be determined)
*   **Backend:** (To be determined)
*   **LLM Integration:** Google Gemini, Llama 4 (or other models accessible via OpenRouter API)
*   **API:** OpenRouter for LLM access

## Project Status

This project is currently in the conceptual phase. The focus is on defining the core functionalities and user experience for generating highly specific and effective algorithms.
